Task 4: Creating UI

-->In this Task I Had used Third Party Libray they are:
   >ButterKnife - Field and method binding for Android views which uses annotation processing to generate boilerplate code for you.
   >FABRevealLayout-A layout to transition between two views using a Floating Action Button

--> I had Created the static feilds as shown in the UI
-->Took activity_main.xml I did as below 
             <RelativeLayout>
                   <LinearLayout>.....................to show the date as shown in ui
                   </LinearLayout>
                   <TextView>
                   </Textview>........................to show the week 
                   <FABRevealLayout>
                      <FloatingActionButton/>.................floating action button
                      <LinearLayout></LinearLayout>...........Intial Layout before animation takesplace
                      <RelativeLayout></RelativeLayout>.......secondary layout after animation
                   </FABRevealLayout>
            </RelativeLayout>
-->In MainActivity.Class

   >Using ButterKnife i had bind the views with the variables.
   >Then Using ConfigureFABReveal() method configured the FABRevealLayout

   > private void configureFABReveal() {
        fabRevealLayout.setOnRevealChangeListener(new OnRevealChangeListener() {
            @Override
            public void onMainViewAppeared(FABRevealLayout fabRevealLayout, View mainView) {  
            // we can do here whatever we need in the Initial Layout        
            }

            @Override
            public void onSecondaryViewAppeared(final FABRevealLayout fabRevealLayout, View secondaryView) {
            // we can do here whatever we need in the SecondaryLayout 
            }
        });
    }
-->By clicking on fab button it will take to the secondary layout and 
-->Then by Clicking on cancel button in secondary layout we can go back to main menu 
by using fabreveallayout.revealMainView();
